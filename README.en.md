### [QuarkList](https://github.com/francis-zhao/quarklist/blob/master/dist/quarklist.txt)

An advertising filter for users in mainland China, applicable to general blocker extensions of browser such as [Adblock Plus](https://adblockplus.org/ "Adblock Plus"), [AdBlock](https://getadblock.com/ "AdBlock"), [uBlock Origin](https://github.com/gorhill/uBlock "uBlock Origin"), etc. As a supplement to official `EasyList` and `EasyList China`, it can enhance capability of advertising filtering.

### [hosts](https://github.com/francis-zhao/quarklist/blob/master/dist/hosts)

The hosts rule that blocks advertisement domain names can be used not only for browser, but also for all programs, but it can only block specific domain names and cannot provide more applicable block rules. Therefore, **it is not recommended for general usage**.

You may replace or append the rules in the hosts file to the `C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts` in Windows system or the `/etc/hosts` in Linux and macOS systems and save it to take effect.
